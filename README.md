Creating a Simple Map with Folium and Python


INTRODUCTION
folium makes it easy to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
Often when working with data, you have access to geospatial features such as latitude and longitude coordinates. It can be interesting to map these to get an idea of how instances of a data set are spread across different locations.
i used pandas to analyze the data and folium with visualization.

GEOSPECIFIC LIBRARIES
Folium : https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/
Pandas : https://pandas.pydata.org/

DATA
 I took the bike rental location data and show the locations on a map. I use Dublin Bikes data (https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/dublinbikes-api).


TASK
 How to get bike rental location data, create a simple map, and add points to it for each location using Folium in Python.

CHALLENGE ENCOUNTER
 Unable to get the right folium marker funtion to mark multiple location.
